simple_prelude
==============

A Prelude for Scala containing standard typeclasses, instances, lenses, and more.  Not really simple.

Emphasis on clarity, applicatives, and implicit-agnosticism.  (Thanks to the lack of newtypes
implicit resolution in Scala is less than ideal.)

How to run
----------
$ sbt compile

$ sbt test

$ sbt package
